        <summary>2025-05-15</strong> – Started weather fetcher (Python) app.</summary>
        <p>Late start today due to watching pets for friend. Sat down and had forgotten I had not installed intellij on my fresh install of Linux Mint. Once that was all setup and done I dove in but ran into issues with calling the API. I thought I knew enough, apparently there are gaps in this area for me.</code>.</p>

        <summary>2025-05-14</strong> – Linked newly made web pages to website and updated all entries.</summary>
        <p>Not much to say, I goofed, named my file "projects" instead of "projects.html" and spent too much time scratching my head over this silly mistake. Otherwise, the rest was straight forward.()</code>.</p>

        <summary>2025-05-13 – Set up Journal and Projects pages for website.</summary>
        <p>Taking this bit in small steps. Not in a huge rush to get it all out. Currently aiming to make sure its neat but functional. Had issues with Github, actually, to be fair, still am. Not used to the site and its a bit to take in, along with brushing up on html.()</code>.</p>
