        <summary><strong>2025-06-025</strong> – Chapter 6: Completed lab 6.4 - 6.6 in Python Crash Course Book. </summary>
        <p> Each lab built off the other, setting up, entering key / values, only each lab setup a different scenario. At the end there was a call for those key and values. 6.3 was the more rubber to road moment cause i actually wrote the dictionary, but by end of 6.5 where i ran a for loop I realized 6.6 was nearly identical with its requirements and a simple copy-paste and touch ups to key and values granted me the results needed to pass the lab. Overall, these three were fairly easy. </p>

        <summary><strong>2025-06-024</strong> – Installed and setup ComfyUI + Wan 2.1.</summary>
        <p> (Side Project) Worked on installing locally ComfyUI. The process in installing was "okay". The files and their size was larger than anticipated. That and I ran into a few issues in generating but around 10:30pm I finally got my first image to video done </p>

        <summary><strong>2025-06-023</strong> – Chapter 6: Completed lab 6.1 - 6.3 in Python Crash Course Book.</summary>
        <p> The labs worked on consisted of experimenting on dictionaries. First was to create a dictionary and call on its contents, the later labs involved loops and outputting the dictionaries  </p>

        <summary><strong>2025-06-010</strong> – Completed chpt5 in Python Crash Course Book.</summary>
        <p>Part of the weather app required calling an API, which after floundering I realized I'm more than a bit rusty. I've grabbed a Python book and have ripped through the first 5 chapters. Starting the labs in if-else to refresh and will come back to weather app. Moving forward will be progress in book or enough of it until I can go back to weather app.</p>

        <summary><strong>2025-05-15</strong> – Started weather fetcher (Python) app.</summary>
        <p>Late start today due to watching pets for friend. Sat down and had forgotten I had not installed IntelliJ on my fresh install of Linux Mint. Once that was all set up and done I dove in but ran into issues with calling the API. I thought I knew enough, apparently there are gaps in this area for me.</p>

        <summary><strong>2025-05-14</strong> – Linked newly made web pages to website and updated all entries.</summary>
        <p>Not much to say, I goofed, named my file "projects" instead of "projects.html" and spent too much time scratching my head over this silly mistake. Otherwise, the rest was straightforward.</p>

        <summary><strong>2025-05-13</strong> – Set up Journal and Projects pages for website.</summary>
        <p>Taking this bit in small steps. Not in a huge rush to get it all out. Currently aiming to make sure it's neat but functional. Had issues with GitHub—actually, to be fair, still am. Not used to the site and it's a bit to take in, along with brushing up on HTML.</p>
