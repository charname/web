          <summary><strong>2025-07-24</strong> – TrueNAS Core upgrade to TrueNAS Scale</summary>
          This project has been ongoing since the 19th, with the main objective being to set up Immich. While it is possible to run a Linux VM on TrueNAS Core and install Docker within it, I was presented with the option to upgrade to TrueNAS SCALE. SCALE allows Docker to run natively on the host OS, which reduces overhead compared to using a VM.

The process ended up being more complex than anticipated. Although TrueNAS Core offered a built-in upgrade path, it was unable to upgrade directly to version 25. I attempted to install an older version of SCALE instead, but it lacked the necessary features for installing Immich.

Ultimately, I had to perform a clean installation of SCALE, import my backed-up configuration files, and make a few adjustments along the way. Immich is not fully operational yet, but it is currently in progress.</p></details>

          <p>These labs built upon each other, each focusing on different dictionary scenarios. Lab 6.5 was a turning point where I wrote a full dictionary, and 6.6 reused that format with minor changes. Overall, these were straightforward and enjoyable.</p>
