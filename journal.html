          <summary><strong>2025-07-24</strong> – TrueNAS Core upgrade to TrueNAS Scale</summary>
          <p>This has been an ongoing project starting from the 19th. The main objective is to get Immich setup. However, while possible to setup a VM on TrueNAS Core, running linuxm then docker. I was prersent an option to upgrade to SCALE which can run docker from TrueNAS OS, not from a VM which would be less overhead. The overall process in doing this ended up being a longer route than anticipated. CORE had a way to upgrade but it was unable to upgrade to version 25, so ended up install a older version but this version lacked the functions I was looking for to install immich. Ultimately, I had to re-installl the OS, import by backedupu config files, and tinker a few misc things here and there. immich is not working, yet, but is in the process.</p>

          <p>These labs built upon each other, each focusing on different dictionary scenarios. Lab 6.5 was a turning point where I wrote a full dictionary, and 6.6 reused that format with minor changes. Overall, these were straightforward and enjoyable.</p>
