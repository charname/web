Personal learning and documentation site focused on development, systems, and cybersecurity.

This repository backs my GitHub Pages site, where I track hands-on projects, labs, and a technical journal as I build practical experience across Python, Linux, infrastructure, and security tooling.

## What’s here

- **Projects**  
  Security tooling, automation, infrastructure labs, and small development projects.

- **Development**  
  Skill progression across Python, web basics, virtualization, storage, and security fundamentals.

- **Journal**  
  Chronological technical notes covering experiments, troubleshooting, migrations, and learning milestones.

## Focus Areas

- Python fundamentals and automation  
- Linux, virtualization, and self-hosted services  
- Security tooling (email security, phishing simulations, endpoint platforms)  
- Vulnerability assessment, scanning, and lab-based learning

## Site

The site is built as a static HTML/CSS project and hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

This repository is intentionally simple and documentation-first.  
It reflects ongoing learning rather than polished, finished products.
